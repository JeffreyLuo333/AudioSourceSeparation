<UL>
  <LI>Sound interruption or other less-than-perfect outcomes may be experienced if your computer's performance and specifications are somewhat inadequate. The types of applications you use and the way in which you use them can also influence the experience you receive.</LI>
  <LI>If the PC is started up while the Roland RD is still connected to the PC with its power turned on, the driver may not be loaded properly and you may not be able to use the Roland RD. In such cases, connect the Roland RD to another USB port or turn on the power of Roland RD after the PC starts up.</LI>
  <LI>If the Roland RD does not work correctly after resuming from Sleep mode, you should exit all applications that use the Roland RD, and then turn the power of the Roland RD off and on again.</LI>
  <LI>If the USB cable is disconnected and reconnected while the Roland RD is in use, or if the power of the Roland RD is turned off, then on again, it may stop operating correctly. If this occurs, after resuming, you should exit all applications that use the Roland RD, and turn the power of the Roland RD off, then on again.</LI>
  <LI>If your computer was experiencing a heavy processing load, such as when accessing a CD-ROM Drive or network while the Roland RD was being used, the Roland RD may no longer operate correctly. If this occurs, stop the playback or recording, then try starting playback or recording over again. If you are still unable to play back or record, quit all programs that are using the Roland RD, then turn the Roland RD off and then on again.</LI>
